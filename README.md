a simple mean mvc setup

##Getting Started
Make sure you have installed Bower for the front-end libraries:
```
$ npm install -g bower
```

Just install the module via npm:
```
$ npm install
```

Run the server like this:
```
$ node server
```

This will install all the required node modules and bower modules.

##Automaticly restart node server
Nodemon is a module which will restart when a change is made

Install it globally like this:
```
$ npm install -g nodemon
```

Now you can run your server like this:
```
$ nodemon
```
This will search for the correct file and start the server
